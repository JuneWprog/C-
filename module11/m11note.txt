problem 5
use ntp_client() to get seconds from the ntp server
substract the seconds with TIME1970 = 2208988800L 
use time.localtime(sec) convert seconds to structure.
the data sent out is a tuple, on the udpclient side, 
I sliced the tuple,to get riddle of "NTP Time :"
take the rest of the tuple, (that is the time portion),
 and then convert the time to local time. 


problem 6
python bhnet.py -l -p 9999 -c
python bhnet.py -t localhost -p 9999
ctrl -d
echo -ne "GET/HTTP/1.1\r\nHost:www.google.com\r\n\r\n"|python bhnet.py -t www.google.com -p 80
sudo python m11proxy.py 127.0.0.1 80 itss.biomea.com 80 True
set m11tcpcli.py host=127.0.0.1

Problem 7 
1>Modify m11tcpcli.py  line 5  host ="itss.biomea.com" to host="127.0.0.1"  
2>On one terminal run proxy program : sudo python m11proxy.py 127.0.0.1 80 itss.biomea.com 80 True
3>open another terminal, run tcpclient: python m11tcpcli.py

On the terminal running proxy, we received the traffic dump running on the tcp client side.
First we received 58bytes from tcp client to itss.biomea, which is the request the tcp client
sent out.
Then, we received 331bytes from itss.biomea to the tcp client. The data dump shows the content of 
the webpage sent from itss.biomea.
