Problem 1 
Heapover001.png                 shows disassembly code of main, two breakpoints are set.
                                one after  the heap initialized by malloc, 
                                the other after the strcpy, which write data in to the heap.

Heapover002.png                 run heapover.exe with string 12*'A'.
                                print out the memory address of heap.
                                print the contents in the initialized heap.   

Heapvover003.png                shows the heap after the long string is written in it. 
                                system warning: the size of data written in heap past requested size.
                                kernel sent a signal SIGTRAP, which terminated the program.

The program heapover.exe crashes when the heap is modified by a long string. 
It crashes because the size of the string is greater than the memory size we assigned to the heap.
